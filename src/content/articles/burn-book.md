Dear Interlake,

No, despite the name of our article name and signature, this column is not an angst-filled, petty, or mean replica of the “burn book” from the 2004 classic film “Mean Girls.”

Instead, it’s our way of showing that we care about you. We want to help wherever we can. And what better way to help you than to nosily involve ourselves in your personal problems? We all love a good dose of tea!

Drawing inspiration from the classic “Dear Abby” column, we decided to give some unrequited, free advice to one of our friends at Interlake, who is struggling with some real relationship problems!

So, what is the problem that she needs help with?

(Note: Responses have been edited for clarity and length)

“Okay, so I was dating this guy, but I broke up with him. While I was dating him, my friend (in the same friend group as me) would always text him. They talked about me every night. I broke up with him, and she immediately began to support him. In class, she always flirts with my ex and talks to him like they’re best friends. They still text every night, even afterwe broke up. She’s also been trying to make my friends take sides post-breakup.

Should I cut her out of my friend group?”

First of all: Wow.

Second of all: Wow.

Third of all: We definitely have some advice for you!

Since this girl has been flirting with your ex, directly interacting with her may be draining you and your other friends of some of your happiness. However, we think that it’s important for you to speak with her in case there’s something that isn’t being communicated between you two. You want to make certain that cutting your friend out of your group is really the best thing to do.

After talking with her, if you both decide that it is best for you to part ways, that’s okay. What’s not okay is taking a more subtle approach - slowly not “remembering” to respond to her texts, forgetting friend group hangouts, avoiding her in the halls. If you gradually cut her out of your life without talking to her first, she may have no idea what she did wrong! Also, gradually cutting her out will definitely cause more awkwardness; not being on the same page often blows up a problem that will more negatively affect you, her, and your friends.

Anyways, we’re rooting for you! Good luck!  

(And to the rest of the high school population, this is your sign to not flirt with your friends’ exes.)

XOXO,

IHS “Mean Girls”

P.S.

Us IHS Mean Girls received a DM stating: “A little birdie told me that the people running this account are absolute bombshells.”

We would like to respond to the DM by asserting that your little birdie speaks straight up facts.
