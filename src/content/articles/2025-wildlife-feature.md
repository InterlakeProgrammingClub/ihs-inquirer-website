Some people see crows as an omen of bad luck, others see them as a symbol of intelligence or a sign of good luck. However you see crows, you’ve probably seen around fifteen to twenty crows on Interlak’s campus, perched on the fringes of roofs or high in the dense branches of the evergreens. Observe them long enough and you might get the chance to watch them play tag, scavenge forgotten crumbs, or mob the nesting ospreys.

These clever birds are one of the most recognizable species, since they are quite large and jet black, with very few lookalikes. Crows are omnivorous ground foragers and are unafraid of humans, even when they approach. 

Not only can crows make and use tools, but they have exceptional facial recognition (probably better than yours) and can converse with each other. If you offend or attack a crow, it will definitely remember you, and will also tell its friends and family about you – don’t underestimate their communication skills. And if you’re really, really unlucky, you’ll become a generational enemy of a crow family, a victim.

So since the crows of Interlake probably recognize you, take the time to notice the crows next time you are strolling across campus.
