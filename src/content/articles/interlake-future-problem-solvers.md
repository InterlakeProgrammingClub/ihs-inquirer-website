You may have noticed in past years that the third week in March is rife with absences. The root of these absences can be traced to the Future Problem Solvers State Bowl, the state-level competition that takes place at Warm Beach, Stanwood, WA, from March 20th to March 22nd. We decided to ask participants a few questions regarding the program to find out more about what makes Future Problem Solvers so appealing.

Future Problem Solvers, or FPS, is a program available to students from grades 4-12 that is meant to encourage critical analysis and futuristic thinking.There are four competitions in which people can participate, though Interlake participates in only three - Global Issues Problem Solving, Scenario Writing, and Scenario Performance.

In these divisions, competitors identify challenges or potential problems in a hypothetical scenario set in the future and create solutions to an underlying problem of their choosing. The topics for these future scenes range from self-driving vehicles to tourism, urbanization, and more.

We’re proud to say that all twenty or so members of Interlake FPS made it to the State Bowl last year! For this article, we interviewed participants of all different experience levels and divisions regarding their experiences with state competition and FPS in general.

So, why do students do FPS?

Students see FPS as a great way to practice critical thinking and develop practical skills that could be useful in the future. Ninth grader Sana says that FPS is unique and “teaches you critical thinking skills” in a different way from the many other clubs that also encourage deeper thinking. Anvika, a 10th grader, has said that FPS is a “super practical and diverse” activity for her, with a wide variety of different competitions and opportunities for applying one’s skills internationally. Ninth grader Vedika and her older sister Prisha see FPS as a fun, community-building activity, and have said they “enjoy learning about futuristic topics” and discovering new ways to “utilize creative thinking skills.”

What was the experience like at Warm Beach, where the State Bowl was held?

Despite its name, Warm Beach was cold at the time of the competition. For many such as ninth grader Sakti, the state competition was a new experience, and many first-time students “got to know classmates better” through bonding experiences, along with being able to relax and be “away for a bit”. Ninth grader Ada described camp at Warm Beach as a way of “fulfilling all our lost Camp Orkila dreams,” as many of us were unable to experience the long-awaited 6th grade camp due to the pandemic.

For those who qualify, the competition after State Bowl is the International Conference, taking place this year at the University of Indiana from June 5th to June 9th. We’d like to offer congratulations to all members who participated in FPS this year, and good luck to all those advancing to Internationals!

“Join FPS!” Anvika cheers, to hearty agreement from several other cookie-eating FPS members celebrating State Bowl and all the work they’ve done to get there.
