As fall sports wrap up, our teams have shown incredible resilience and drive, making this season something to remember. We interviewed key players from various teams to get an inside look at their journeys, challenges, and what drives them to give their all on the track, course, and pool.

On the cross country team, captain Marshall Tsai gave us a glimpse into the importance of trusting the process along with impromptu songs. “Everything will be okay in the end. If it’s not okay, it’s not the end.

When asked about his favorite memory, he recalls his first race in freshman year with GOAT Matthew and Chipotle with the XC SQUAD. He tells freshmen to join cross country because it is super supportive and funny and will give you abs of steel and quads!

Meanwhile, on the golf team, junior Sam Haufe emphasizes the importance of “making sure to talk to your coach because they will always help you, especially Coach Calvert because he’s fun”. He stayed motivated through the hot and challenging practices by remembering “that there is more to \[his] round than just one hole”. His favorite memory from this golf season is “the match against Bellevue because they are the best and \[he] played well”.

Splashes were made by the swim team, with Junior KingCo qualifier Blythe Chen sharing her thoughts on the season, saying, “everyone put in so much effort, and it’s been amazing to see each swimmer improve. The energy and support we have for each other really pushed us through the tough meets.” Blythe’s most memorable moment was team dinner at Red Robin, which has exemplified the team spirit that has grown throughout the swim season! Her biggest inspiration is Trinity Lee, one of the swim captains, who is such a joy at practices! For incoming freshmen, Blythe advises them to have fun and meet as many new people as they can. And remember that difficult losses will always pass, and times would eventually drop!

This season, our fall sports teams reminded us of what dedication, teamwork, and a passion for the game looks like. Congratulations to all the athletes, coaches, and fans for a fantastic season, and we look forward to even more success in the winter season!

Go Saints!
