The Commons were bustling with people, music, and color as Interlake High School hosted its 3rd Annual International Fair on April 3rd, organized by the Interlake PTSA. The event brought together students, staff, and parents for a presentation of Interlake culture. Events included boards featuring many of Interlake’s clubs, booths for many languages and cultures from countries around the world, and class fundraising booths for each grade.

	With many cultural booths hosted by Interlake families and student groups, the fair really lives up to its “International” name. Attendees sampled dumplings, mung bean soup, crepes, curry, fajitas, and more, while admiring handmade crafts and displays that shared the traditions of countries around the world. One of the prominent displays was the French booth, bringing in baguettes, croissants, crepes, and ratatouille. Another station with delicious food was the pot of curry and bread, vanishing in a heartbeat after students lined up to try it. Sophomore Lucas Lu, one of the volunteers, praised the event, saying that “the food was really good,” a testament to the wonderful world cuisines represented at Interlake.

	There were many clubs present as well, including the Interlake Woodshop, Interlake Bridge Club, the Interlake Inquirer, and the Ping Pong team. Vikhyath Bulusu, a talented ping pong player brought some paddles, balls, and a ping pong table. Many eager students attempted to challenge him but found themselves unable to match his “snake shot,” where he puts an incredible amount of spin on the ball. Interlake Woodshop brought many of their creations, including a functional table and many other cool objects. 

	Finally, there were class booths with fun activities designed for fundraising. A prime example was the booth from the class of 2026, headed by Victor Fu-Zhou and Tim Yin. They had structured a game after Game Pigeon’s Cup Pong, where a contestant had to stand behind a line and attempt to throw ping pong balls into cups. Although free to play, missing all three balls would cause you to be in debt of 2 dollars, and each ball made would increase the amount you won by one. Drilling all three awarded you a dollar and a delicious egg tart. The idea was ingenious, but some unlucky students fell into a rabbit hole of gambling, racking up dollar after dollar in debt. 

	With growing participation and excitement each year, the International Fair has become somewhat of a tradition, a time to share unique cultures from around the world. With approval from the students and parents alike, this year’s event was a smashing success!
