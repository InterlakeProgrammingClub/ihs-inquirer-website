description: Politics at Interlake

Before and after the election, politics have been a hot topic around Interlake. Whether they are republican, democrat, or independent, students have most likely discussed something pertaining to politics (abortion, the economy, memes) at some point in the past few months. However, when asking students to publicly discuss their hopes and fears for the new administration, many asked to remain anonymous– something that sparked another question. Why are students scared to express their opinions in a public space?

When asked about their hopes and fears for the new administration, some people responded that their number one fear pertains to immigration and the new deportations. “Because I am not a citizen, there is always uncertainty regarding my status.” Others responded with “abortion/reproductive rights has always been a big concern, and with a Republican government, I’m scared of what might happen to abortion/reproductive care access.” However, some people have hopes for the future, especially regarding the economy. Someone replied that “under the Biden administration, prices were too high to the point where basic necessities were the only thing we could buy. I hope that Trump will fix the economy to lead to lower prices and easier access to goods.” As you can see, responses were a mixed bag, some with hopes, others with fears, and some with a little of each.

However, when told that this would be on the record, with their names and grades for everyone to see, many decided to withdraw their interview. When asked why, one person responded that they were “scared that colleges might see. My parents will kill me if they see this.” Politics is an increasingly sensitive topic, especially because of the extensive and heated debates that occur online. However, taken out of context, it could lead to a trail of negative digital footprints that colleges may consider in their decisions. Differences of political opinion have also led to tensions between family members. Another person responded that “as a Republican, I’m a minority and I’m scared that people will turn on me for being one.” Because we attend a primarily liberal school, some students are afraid to voice their conservative views.

One concern that arises from this situation is whether or not free speech is still really free. Politics used to be a relatively common thing to discuss in public, but now it happens behind closed doors. We no longer know what may be sent to colleges, schools, and how that might affect us, even if all we said was a basic comment regarding the economy or abortion rights. Secondly, political polarization is becoming exceedingly common. Instead of a gradient of different political beliefs, its two different shades: red and blue. That causes tensions between the two groups, primarily because the ideologies are completely opposite to the point of complete disagreement. It seems that we have become tribal, wearing our tribe’s colors, speaking our tribe’s language, and inhabiting our tribe’s spaces, both literal and ideological. Will we ever learn to talk to each other again?
