Every year, the craze of math competitions begins in November as multiple Interlake students sit in a classroom and take the AMC (American Mathematics Competition) exam. They are aiming to get into more selective competitions like AIME and JMO. These students spend years and years building up their math skills for these competitions, many taking math lessons and doing hundreds of problems. So, why do so many Interlake kids spend multiple grueling hours every week for these math competitions?

“I started off math competitions due to parental expectations and mostly peer pressure, given that most of my classmates were also doing competition math,” says Eva Xu. “A part of the reason why I still do it is because of college applications… I don't really like math in itself, like if there was no reason for me to, I wouldn't be doing math for fun.”

However, Xu does admit that she loves the “competition math community and the people.”

While Xu seems to continue doing math competitions for college applications and because of the prevalence of math throughout Interlake, she still seems willing to do it with her friends.

Jeffrey Zhao disagrees with her, saying that “I don't really do \[math] for college applications, mostly just focusing on improving myself and because I enjoy competition math.”

Richard Hao agrees with Jeffrey and does math competitions out of his own interest because it is a useful skill. “The largest factor that encourages me to continue math competitions is how much more mathematics and problem solving skills you can learn,” says Hao.

Stella Bie’s perspective is a combination of all of them, “there seems to be two main motivators: 1) because you genuinely like competition math, or 2) you have friends in competition math which makes it fun. For me, it is a combination of the two.”

She does not agree with Xu’s perspective about doing math for college applications though. Bie states, “I don’t think anyone is doing math for college apps, because if you don’t have genuine interest in competition math, it is going to be actual torture to study.”

Ian Rui says that “it can be fun but also stressful because so many people are so good at math and competitions inherently induce competitiveness and comparing oneself to others.” However, Rui admits that they are “pretty fun.”

These students are all math sweats of varying levels and the reason for it seems to be different for each person. At the end of the day, math competitions work in Interlake: people do it for more friends that share the same interest, college applications, and because of a genuine interest in the subject.
