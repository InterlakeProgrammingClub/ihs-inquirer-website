As the election drew closer and closer, we saw the campaigns of our two presidential candidates unfold and witnessed the use of social media as a tool for campaigning towards younger audiences. Although less than half of all voters aged 18-29 voted, it seems that all the marketing on social media is geared to them, given that the most common demographic on TikTok and Instagram is those aged 18-34. 

But what exactly am I talking about? 

You might have heard of the various memes surrounding the election from Kamala HQ being brat, the assaination attempt on Donald Trump, and the veritable gold mine the presidential debate left us such as the grossly inaccurate stereotype about “eating the cats and dogs” (Disclaimer: this is a highly inaccurate and offensive stereotype that should not be taken seriously or spread as fact). But all these memes don’t exactly inform younger voters of policy and the structural change candidates bring to government. For example, the DNC and RNC, conventions that inform voters on policy changes, didn’t seem to reach young people. 

When asked about her views on the DNC or RNC Hannah Hayden stated that she only knew a little bit about the RNC from watching it with her grandma. Instead, things like memes about the presidential debate reach younger audiences and this doesn’t really inform anybody on policies. Instead, it was portrayed like a cat fight between two “not-quite” adults. The reason it seems these candidates want to connect with their younger audience is because they know they aren’t even remotely like their younger voters. 

So, what does this mean for the future of our country? Well, let’s ask people around our school: According to Hannah Hayden (’27), she knows about memes such as Harris saying “Wakanda Forever”, Trump going to McDonald’s, and Trump saying that immigrants will eat the cats and dogs (Disclaimer: once again, such language perpetuates harmful misconceptions and promotes division. Such harmful and misleading generalizations are not fact and should be regarded as negative and hurtful stereotypes). These memes did amuse her; however, they didn’t seem to inform her about any of the policies of the candidates. When asked about if she knew about the policies of either candidate, she said she knew about Trump's abortion ban, and his adamance on keeping immigrants out. Memes about Donald Trump seemed to inform these opinions. This seems to be different from previous years when most of Republican’s memes were focused on demonizing the other candidates, with Clinton in 2016 and Biden in 2020. 

This year, the memes seem to have flipped to make fun of Trump himself. For example, when asked about how Trump saying, “they’re eating the cats and dogs”, Sophie Mustain (’27) said it made her feel uncomfortable due to the racist undertones. This discouraged her from voting in the future. We can see the real-world effects memes like this have on adolescents' likelihood of voting in the future. While some of these memes are found to be funny a lot of them are offensive and further harm the future of our already politically charged landscape. So, Interlake, if you can vote, think about who you’re voting for and why. Every vote matters, so use yours wisely.
