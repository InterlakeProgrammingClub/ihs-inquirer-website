It’s no secret gaming holds a big part in Interlake’s culture, from the lunches full of Brawl Stars, to an entire club dedicated to mobile gaming, it looks like no one can stop gaming! When we asked the mobile gaming club what they’re favorite game was, an astounding 90% of the members said Brawl Stars was their favorite game.  

Now you may be asking yourself, “What is Brawl Stars?”, if you are, get your head out of your textbook and install it right now. Brawl Stars is a game created by Supercell, a video game company, that specializes in mobile gaming. The game was first released in 2018 and was very popular from 2019-2020. However, due to the pandemic and a myriad of other reasons, the popularity of Brawl Stars took a turn for the worse during 2021-2023. However, eventually, the consistent updates and hard work paid off as in 2024 the game boomed! It reached record highs in number of installs, and has consistently been gaining new players. 

But why are so many people playing Brawl Stars, and why do we have a whole club dedicated to it? “\[Brawl Stars] brings together people through something very common and part of a lot of people's everyday lives that brings them happiness”. Avid Brawl Stars player, sophomore Ayaan Alam tells us. Whereas Ritwik Singh, the president of the Mobile gaming club says that he plays games “to relax and destress”. 

Not only is Brawl Stars popular in the club, it is popular everywhere in the school, especially lunch. “Lunch is primetime for Brawl Stars” says Oscar Li, a sophomore who loves Brawl Stars. “You get free access to your phone, all your friends sitting around you, and 30 minutes to do whatever you want, it’s the perfect place.” Indeed Oscar is not alone in his thoughts, as Arya Kashyap, a hardworking junior agrees that, “at lunch, when I play games, I feel disconnected from the rigorous academics of IHS”. Indeed that’s why David Ohayon, a freshman, finds that simply put, “Brawl Stars is fun”. Additionally, Lucas Lu, a sophomore at Interlake states that he plays “Brawl Stars more than just because it’s fun but rather the progression”. The progression Lucas talks about is his in-game stats, where he can increase the power level of “brawlers”, increase his trophy count, and also unlock unique abilities with it. 

At the end of the day, Brawl Stars is a fun game that almost all Interlake students can enjoy together. It’s what brings many communities together, and sometimes the only commonality that you will be able to find with other students. It’s come to the point where asking for your Brawl Stars code is a better way of keeping in touch rather than Instagram or actual phone numbers. Either way, Brawl Stars helps people disconnect and in turn, make new connections.
