As the Fall Sports Season is about to end, our school has had some truly remarkable accomplishments in sports – great job Saints! The Interlake Tennis Team is one of our school’s most successful teams. Varsity finished at the top of their league with 9 wins and 0 losses! Let’s see what our amazing team has to say about matches, performance, practice, and what they love about school tennis! 

Freshman Chris Jin from the Junior Varsity team states that the season was “great! We worked very well as a team and the team spirit was insane.” Sophomore Max Kumar, also from JV, affirms this, saying “we won almost all of our league matches, winning 8 in a row.” Fellow sophomore Albert Zhang in Varsity adds on, stating that varsity was “undefeated in conference matches.” Head Coach Matthew Perlman agrees: “Our team has been doing great this season. We finished undefeated in our Mountain Division.”

A successful season comes with a few tough matches and opponents. Mercer Island’s tennis team tops the list, with junior Aden George from JV and freshman Patrick Sun in Varsity stating “Mercer Island are our biggest opponents. People felt the pressure of going up against an insanely good team.” It was also one of the only teams our school lost to. In addition, sophomore Ali Ismail in JV cites Bellevue High School as an extremely memorable match: “We expected to lose to them very badly, but we managed to get the upset win!” Coach Perlman also “loved beating Bellevue High School 5-2 on our home courts.” Overall, it seemed everyone enjoyed both playing against good opponents as well as feeling the savor of winning. 

Now let’s take a dive into the team’s daily practice. JV Freshman Daniel Stepan thinks “practice was fine in general.” His fellow freshman Minh Do and sophomore Max Kumar agree, but think that more “drills could be run, or some type of organized match play like bump. A little more time for challenge matches would be great.” Most of our tennis team are in agreement with each other that they need better supplies. Varsity junior Deepinder Singh wants “better balls” and “better tools to clear our courts when wet.” Coach Perlman concurs, saying “We could use a squeegee, broom, and some towels for all of the wet spots.” It will be up to the school district to provide improved court conditions as well as practice supplies for the tennis team! 

Wrapping up this discussion, let’s hear from members of the team about their goals for the coming year! Freshman Vivaan Madan wants to “make doubles or singles in JV” and improve his overall technique, sophomore Albert Zhang would like to “beat Mercer Island High,” and junior Deepinder Singh has the ambitious goal of “making state without dropping a set.” Besides these impressive targets our team has set for themselves, they always find fun in the team. Sun really enjoyed the “culture and cool people here.” Jin found “playing with friends” very fun. Meanwhile, Ismail just thinks “the school spirit this year was the best part.” As Coach Perlman puts it, “the one thing I like the most about coaching is connecting with the players. I feel really fortunate to work with such amazing student athletes and I am very thankful for that.” 

Last but not least, let’s give it up to the Interlake Tennis team captain this year, Andrew Yoon, our only senior in tennis! Andrew will never forget “the final match of the season as it was my final match of my high school tennis experience.” He found it very “touching whenever loud cheers would come” from the rest of his team. He will “make sure to play tennis during college.”  Wherever he goes, the tennis team really appreciates you, Andrew, and good luck! 

That being said, let’s give it up again for a wonderful season of Interlake tennis and hope to see the same dedication in the coming years!
