description: Transition from middle school to high school

After a year at Interlake, many current sophomores reflect on how their mindset changed during freshman year. The transition from middle school to high school can be jarring, with the change in environment, new classmates, and *oh my god where is the language building??* 

Ruochen Xu states that her academic mindset changed since entering high school, “In middle school it felt like grades and extracurriculars didn't matter as much, but now I feel more pressure to do well in school.” While many are feeling the pressure, others have learned perspective, like Jayden Park who says “in middle school… I would get stressed over the tiniest things and couldn't get past them, but in high school I've just learned to accept the small mistakes I might make.” 

With the transition from middle to high school comes a shift in social relationships as well. As Isabelle Wang states “a lot of people I knew from middle school have gone to Newport High School and I miss them quite a bit.” Losing friends is one of the hardest parts of going to a new school. Parineeta Kapoor has instead taken the time to “\[make] many friends and \[reach] my goals for the year while still having fun.” 

For Vaishvi Reddy “the biggest change would prolly be the classes, some are easy, but most of them are tough classes,” while for Shlok Ainapure there has been very little change. “The biggest change I have noticed about myself is actually not much except for an accent change and a little bit of height growth.” 

The transition from middle school to high school is different for everyone. Some see big changes in their academics, friends, and classes while others don’t relate. Still, it’s a part of everyone’s life and by sophomore year, you can easily find the language building (*wait they changed it to the Transition Center??)*.
