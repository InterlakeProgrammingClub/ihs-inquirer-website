Dear Freshmen, 

Many of you are probably nervous, confused, and maybe reluctant to take your first steps into high school. You’re probably also worried about your classes, clubs, and the weight on your shoulders knowing that your classes will only grow more challenging. So here are several messages from different people (including myself) on how to survive - nay, thrive - in your first year of high school.

These are general messages from some sophomores that you may or may not know. First, Kayleigh Wong would like you to know that “time is precious, and it goes by quickly, so enjoy it when you can”. Sitara Kumar advises that you “make sure to put effort into balancing your social life, academics, and allotting yourselves individual time to relax”. Finally, I, the author, would like you to know that freshman year’s workload is the easiest out of all four years - so make sure to enjoy it.

Next, we have a list of things that some sophomores ended up regretting… so listen carefully. You might end up regretting not participating in enough clubs, as William Yoon reflects that he “would’ve tried out more in freshman year, but didn’t”. Mercy Li also implores that you “start studying for your exams on time”, and I must agree that procrastinating for your exams is not a good idea unless you want to be pulling a few unpleasant all-nighters.

Finally, since most of you probably don’t know what clubs are the most popular, we have compiled for you a collection of some sophomores’ favorite clubs. My personal favorites are Speech & Debate and, naturally, the Inquirer. Some of Sitara’s favorites were HOSA, SciOly, and Biotech. Mercy’s favorite was debate… and William’s favorites were S&D, and the Inquirer once again. But don’t take our word for it - remember that which clubs you’ll end up liking depends on your individual interests, so just try everything out and you’ll find something you really love.

I hope this brief collection of advice helped! Please know that every upperclassman has been in your shoes, so if you have any questions about school, classes, or life in general, be sure to direct them to the sophomores, juniors, or seniors around you.
