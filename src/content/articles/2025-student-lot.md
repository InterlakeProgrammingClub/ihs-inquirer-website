Every morning at Interlake High feels like a race against time—and not the kind we signed up for. While most of us students are already stressed about getting to class on time, the daily chaos in our student parking lot only adds fuel to the fire. As a senior who's been dealing with this frustration for years, I need to speak up about an issue that’s affecting our entire school community.

Let’s be real: the student parking lot isn’t meant for parent drop-offs. The signs around campus clearly say so, yet it seems like some parents either ignore these rules or simply don’t notice them. When you drive into our lot, you’re not only breaking the rules, you’re also creating a major inconvenience for those of us trying to navigate our mornings. We students rely on a smooth, predictable routine to get to class on time, and every car parked where it shouldn’t be throws a wrench into our plans.

Imagine this: you’re already running late, and the parking lot is a mess. Cars are blocking spots, and drivers are creeping along at a snail’s pace. We know safety is important, but when your vehicle slows down too much or stops in the wrong place, it forces us to swerve around obstacles or circle endlessly for a parking spot. These delays not only make us anxious but also cause real disruptions in our schedule, making it harder to get to class and start the day on a positive note.

This isn’t about pointing fingers or starting drama, it’s about making our mornings better for everyone. We understand that mornings can be hectic for parents too, and dropping off your kid is just one of the many tasks on your busy schedule. However, following the designated drop-off zones and driving at a reasonable pace would go a long way in helping us students. It’s a small change that can make a big difference in our daily routine.

To all the parents still using the student parking lot for drop-offs: please, listen to us when we say enough is enough. Your actions have a direct impact on our day-to-day lives, and a few simple adjustments can make a world of difference.
