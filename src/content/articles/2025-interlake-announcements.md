We are back from Spring Break, and we hope that everyone had a chance to relax, far away from our mundane school routine. As we head into the home stretch, we’re looking for some changes and improvements that can be made next year. With this hope in mind, let’s talk about one of our school’s daily routines: announcements.  

We hear announcements every single day in 2nd period (or 3rd on Thursdays), and these include the pledge of allegiance, what’s for lunch, and other important information like special schedules and upcoming testing. Let’s hear what our students have to say about announcements, starting with the pledge of allegiance. 

Out of the students we interviewed, a surprising 44% say they actually do the pledge of allegiance (albeit very, very, occasionally). Thus, most people say that the pledge of allegiance shouldn’t be changed. Senior Class Officer Alexandra Hui agrees, saying that “No, nothing really should be changed.” She adds “I think state law requires it.” However, there are some of our students who’d like to see some modifications, such as sophomore Lucas Lu who says “I’m not religious, I’d like to know why we need to include ‘God’ in it.” Is there a reason we continue to use this religious language in the pledge? Perhaps this would be a good conversation for ToK class! 

What people think about the bulk of the announcements themselves? Sophomore class officer William Yoon says he and his classmates are mostly “not listening” during announcements; Alexandra Hui agrees saying “normally everyone talks and chats.” For those who can hear the announcements out of the chatter, sophomore Liam Ko “likes announcements” but thinks “they could be shorter.” Senior Chen Liu reflects this sentiment, saying that they are “too long.” I think the general consensus shows disregard for the majority of the announcements… which calls into question their usefulness. 

One of our other sophomore class officers, Ben Wei, personally believes that announcements are “Underrated, and people miss out, especially early in the school year.” He then jokes, saying “Please let announcements be 30 minutes,” no doubt to have more time to just chill. Junior Selim Eke thinks that “they are sometimes too long, and people rarely listen.” Freshman Chris Jin adds on by saying that “Announcements are occasionally useful, but mostly they don’t apply to me.” Sophomores Lucas Lu and Sammy Lei agree with that – they think “ lunch is the only thing that’s useful.” Sammy suggests that “more information on the weather, school-wide events, and birthdays would be much more relatable." We have, in fact, heard announcements begin to cover birthdays recently, but this seems somewhat inconsistent. The school could clearly improve on announcements by broaching subjects that students have actual interest in.

While not everyone can understand the Spanish language portion of the announcements, most students acknowledge that they seem appropriate given our large Hispanic student population. Are there any other languages that should be included?  

All in all, announcements seem to be generally conceived as acceptable amongst students, though we want some changes, especially in the main announcements: more relatable, important information during announcements should be considered, and the length could be shortened as they are accessible in our emails, and most students are not paying attention.
