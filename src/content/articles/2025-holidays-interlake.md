description: Holiday favorites in Interlake

A holiday is always warmly welcomed as a student in high school, especially one that gets you a day off, or better yet, a week. However, when it comes to holidays and breaks, each of us have our personal favorites. To many of us, when we hear the word holiday or the phrase holiday season, our brains jump directly to Christmas and the New Year, filled with national celebrations such as the countdown in Times Square or the Christmas trees and multicolored lights that decorate our towns. Holiday spirit is everywhere from the wreaths on every door and Mariah on Spotify. 

	Sure enough, in a poll several students tagged the holiday of Christmas as their favorite. One sophomore, Ishan Perera, cited the length of winter break and “free stuff” as key reasons for this decision. Many other students echoed this opinion, adding on the “holiday feel” and festivities that take place during that time.

	However, there are some major holidays that fly under the radar. A prime example of this is Thanksgiving. Nikhil Mantrala states that this is his favorite holiday for a variety of reasons, but primarily because it’s “my birthday,” which coincidentally takes place during Thanksgiving Weekend. That combined with the food and family gatherings are enough to give it the nod for his favorite holiday. 

	Although they are not an official national holiday, some people answered our question with birthdays. Birthdays signal growth but also serve as a reflection for our annual activities. Even without the break, a special dinner and a party make the experience more magical. 

	Other holidays mentioned in our poll include Halloween for the mountains of candy you can collect, Chinese New Year because of red packets and the excellent food, and New Year’s because of its symbolic purpose in our society, a time for a reset.

	All in all, holidays at Interlake are highly regarded, and are seen as a time to relax from the heavy loads of homework and stress of tests during the school week. Although Christmas comes on top of this year’s poll, my personal favorite of Thanksgiving has climbed to second place! Maybe next year, turkey lovers!
