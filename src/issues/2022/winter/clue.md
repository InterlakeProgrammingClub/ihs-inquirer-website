Based on the popular board game, Interlake Theatre’s Clue centered around six mysterious guests who were all invited to the same mansion for unknown reasons. Guided by the estate’s charming butler, the guests uncovered secrets, feuds, hidden passages, and more than one dead body. As the characters scrambled to find the killer, they discovered that more was afoot than they had initially believed. Interlake’s cast and crew, led by director Mr. Alex Glover, made their unique mark on this humorous and suspenseful story for this year’s Fall Play.

The play opens on a dark stage, quietly ominous music promising the beginning of an intriguing story. Thunder rings out with a flash of light, and three silhouettes enter, screaming when noticing each other’s presence. It’s our first introduction to the illustrious butler Wadsworth (Yasmine Lo Presti), fanciful maid Yvette (Ava Mishra), and no-nonsense Cook (Alaina Bryzcki), who are frantically preparing Boddy Manor for the arrival of some very special guests.

From the very beginning, we can see that the crew has done a marvelous job. The sound effects, music, and lighting are thoughtfully planned, creating a dark and suspenseful mood. The set itself has been painstakingly painted and designed. Every painting on the wall of the manor appears to have been curated to evoke both the sophistication of a high-profile socialite and the setting of 1954.

The guests arrive one by one, each cleverly accompanied by a shocking background of their respective color. First is Colonel Mustard (Niyati Nayak), a comically clueless military man. Next arrive the elegant, yet morbid, Mrs. White (Delilah Cohen), the flamboyant Mrs. Peacock (Amarrah Gates), and the nervous Mr. Green (Gia Papadopulos). The final two, Professor Plum (Giselle Kendrick) and Ms. Scarlet (Dashiell Pinck), step in together with a flourish. The actors all get an individual moment to shine as they enter the manor, and they make the most of that opportunity. Each character has a distinct personality, which every actor brings out beautifully with each carefully planned movement, glance, and action. Even when it isn’t their turn to speak, the actors remain in character, glancing around, sipping from their champagne glass, or side-eying one another in a way that makes the entire performance feel immersive.

As the play progresses, Wadsworth pushes the story forward with strong narration directed to both the audience and the characters. An encounter with Mr. Boddy (Kathie Li) culminates in the reveal of six weapons and six dangerous secrets, and the audience watches, anxiously but amused, as the guests try to play a game of “charades” while observing Mr. Green choking on a bread roll. Indeed, much of the humor is subtle, and often dark. Each of the characters adds their own humorous edge, whether through the volatile emotions of Mrs. White, the pure idiocy of Colonel Mustard, or the suggestive joking of Ms. Scarlet. Others arrive at the mansion, like a motorist (Jasmine Cociug) and a cop (Sienna Steinhardt), but the audience begins to question the duration of their presence: how long until they die?

Clue is clearly play with a complicated plot, but the flawless set changes, lighting work, and behind-the-scenes work of the crew made the production seem smooth and easy. Through the excellent performances of the cast and the creativity of the crew, Cluepresented a blend of comedy and murder-mystery suspense that captured both the excitement of the board game and the intrigue of the movie. The effort and time that the students and Mr. Glover put in to make the show a success was obvious to every member of the audience.

Just like every Interlake production, Clue was a delight from start to finish! We’re excited to see what Interlake Theatre does next!
