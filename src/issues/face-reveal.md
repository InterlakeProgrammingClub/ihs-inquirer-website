Of all the influencers whose personas revolve around masked anonymity, [Dream](https://www.youtube.com/c/dream)—as known online—is among the most famous. A matter of months ago, the YouTuber removed his plasticky disguise and revealed his face to the world. To his millions of subscribers, it was a monumental event, but not everyone was impressed: reactions ranged from giddy compliments to underwhelmed disappointment, with people insulting his features or commenting that he looked too normal. 

A different type of masking has gripped the world since the COVID-19 pandemic’s start in 2020.

Impacts of the contagion are still widely visible, but with the lifting of masking mandates at school, many have ceased the practice. What are the reasons behind this choice? Why do others continue to wear masks?

Firstly, students are inclined toward what’s most convenient for them. “My family bought a \[lot] of masks,” explains Abigail Liang, a junior, “and there is no other reason to use them but now.” Simultaneously, she says, this helps her keep safe during winter, when “more…sicknesses,” among them COVID-19, are afoot.

But while she doesn’t mind wearing a mask and has no problem breathing in one, an anonymous sophomore has removed theirs because it is physically “uncomfortable.” Masking may be a matter of personal preference, and for some, inhaling or speaking through cotton fabric can inhibit their learning and ability to navigate daily life. Additionally, students are influenced by family practices: a junior wears masks in part because their parents “want \[them] to keep wearing one,” whereas another junior has decided to unmask because their entire family is vaccinated. Students’ choices are a blend of comfort, accessibility, and the practices of family and friends—those who have family members susceptible to sickness may choose to mask.  

The peer pressure and stigma that surround masking choices could be a factor contributing to students’ decisions. While talking to me, one junior expressed that mask-donners might be perceived as “too worried,” “cautious,” or uptight about COVID, while another mentioned that those who don’t could be labelled as “typical anti-masker\[s].” This aversion to playing into perceived stereotypes isn’t new in the teenage world and can contribute to students doing what is most commonly adopted by their circle of friends. Talking to and through masks had become commonplace in everyday life, but now half-familiar faces are showing up again, marking another shift in social navigation. Masking itself might not be the most monumental choice in students’ lives, but the practice is reflective of COVID’s profound impacts, and is yet another aspect to consider within the nuances of societal expectations.  

Since the beginning of the pandemic, the experience of schooling has transformed vastly, shepherding in a host of expectations, burdens, and concerns. In response, students have been adapting, whether it be to virtual schooling, quarantine, returning to in-person learning, or wearing masks. A variety of factors play into the choice of masking, but what’s most important in the uncertainty of current times is that students do what is most comfortable and beneficial to them.
